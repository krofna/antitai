# Sample implementation of a separation algorithm for Tai mapping

The entire implementation is contained in a single file, separate.cpp, which has no dependencies. Simply compile (e.g.)

> g++ separate.cpp -O2 -o separate

And run

> ./separate tree1 tree2 weight_matrix

examples directory contains two sample trees and two sample weight matrices, the first one corresponding to a Tai mapping of weight 4 and the second one to an anti Tai mapping of weight 4.
